===========

A terrible static site generator.

This is a modular site generator for generating websites. By default it's set up for my own website, http://floaternet.net so I recommend changing it to suit your own needs!

On its own the project supports Python 3 and above, but the default mdgenerate module depends on python-markdown.

See the docs folder for instructions on how to write your own generator.
